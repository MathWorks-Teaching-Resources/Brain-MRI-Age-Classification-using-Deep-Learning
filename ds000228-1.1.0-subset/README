Experiment Details
Participants watched Disney Pixar’s “Partly Cloudy” while lying in the scanner. There was no task; participants were simply instructed to lie still and watch the movie. The movie began after 10s of rest (black screen; TRs 1-5). The first 10s of the movie are the opening credits (disney castle, pixar logo; TRs 6-10). 

IPS = 168 TRs
TR = 2s
Experiment length: 5.6 minutes

Pixar Movie Reverse Correlation Events
Events defined by conducting reverse correlation analysis in two separate adult samples, using the average response in ToM brain regions (ToM events) and in the pain matrix (Pain events). Events listed are those that replicated across the two samples.  Onsets and Durations are noted in TRs (1 TR = 2s); scanner trigger = TR 1.

Event types: Theory of Mind (ToM), Physical Sensation/Pain (Pain)
TRs identified by RC analysis, as reported in Richardson et al. 2018

TIMING OF EVENTS FOR MODELING (taking into account hemodynamic lag (4s), scanner trigger = 0):
All timings assume 10s from trigger until movie begins to play.
